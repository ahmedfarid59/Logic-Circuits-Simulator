Before running application, a dependency named "matplotlib" is required to view the results graphically.

'pip install matplotlib'

Then proceed to opening command prompt and changing directory to wherever the project is downloaded/cloned.

Next, run the application using the following command:

'logicsim <library file> <circuit file> <stimuli file>'

The "output.sim" file will contain the results and a graph will pop-up on the screen to view results graphically.
